    <p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside")
        is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular
        point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.
        Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an
        expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
